	Learning how referencing works in Gum is going to be very important
		- May have cooked current project
		- Standard controls are messed up now, god help us all

	Texture swapping. Fully combining everything into one atlas and draw call is likely impractical. 
	However I do think we should optimize our texture swapping a little bit into a few dedicated calls:
		1 backgrounds
		2 objects
		3 UI

	How to apply camera translation to cursor tile finding logic 
	How do we apply camera translation to background and game objects, but not UI?

	Other things to do:
		Get connections to 

/ ---------------- 09 / 05 ------------

	- Camera system - zoom into city? - DONE (more or less, should later add camera smoothing to make it feel less locked - also because lerping is very cool and we should learn how to do it)
	- Drag and drop UI stack panel
	- Towers! - UML time?
	- Implement proper logging system
		- Similar to old project: https://youtu.be/l9e8PJskYnI?si=7KzSJYUQdqGg416U

1. CSV intgrids is the way forward. 

	Need to come up with a way forward for drawing the city ("1/Captured" on the intgrid)
		- Drawing walls on the perimeter, change texture (mountain tile captured)
			- Walk through autotiling with Ryan
			- Is there a way to alter the CSV in the code and have it feed back into Ldtk?
				- Thinking about it already, seems like it would be ideal but also can we integrate that type of active tooling into static packages (deployment builds and instances)

			- Alternatively later on we develop our own autotiling and tileset map scheme and system

1. City Scene

	Want to use LDtk's "super simple export" as a basic image editor -> json/xml pipeline. Minimal complex tool integration & fiddling.
		- Have to write parser for json files
			- Review current approach with Ryan, manual texture atlas definition and tilemap creation might be a little rudimentary
		
		Currently from what I can see the super simple export exports a png per layer, a csv for intgrid layers, and a json file with level info and entity behaviour(waypoints). 
			- How do we handle the tile based city format; placing buildings that snap to 16x16 tiles.   
			- Save and load system that interacts with the intgrid? - Could be on to something
			- How to handle drawing walls on the perimeter of a captured city tile collection.

ADVANCED
	- Monkey city is very barebones with its city building. The only differening tiles are water vs land. Mountain tiles are converted into basic city and so on. 
	  A lot of the city building content revolves around pvp monkey v monkey. Since we're not doing that what are some ways we can introduce engaging systems in
	  the city

1. UI Elements
	//
	- Analyze current code-only gum approach in SlimeMaster game
		- I don't like the code for it honestly. 
		- Observe class patterns and so on.
		- Look through Gum yt tutorial to see if the codegen would be a viable way of implementing the following. Tool seems powerful.
			- First 3 videos are inner workings of gum components

		
	Title screen
	City tiles 
		- City overview
			- Hover on tile? - Difficulty
			- Click on tile? - Level preview
		- Right side column for buildings
			- Drag and drop, right click for info window
	Tower defense level per tile
		- Transition
		- Right side column for tiles. Similar drag and drop, info. 

2. Functionality
	
	City building - secondary. Can leave and just focus on tower defense as a foundation? Or do both - doesn't matter
		- Buildings, tiles (environment), 
	Tower defense 
		- Towers, path (waypoints), enemies, waves.
		- Tilemaps
