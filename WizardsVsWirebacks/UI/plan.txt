Figure out codegen

Do we need 1:1 UI classes corresponding to each scene?

What component / object classes are created


// --- GUM studying ---

First chapter (Intro tutorials) gives good understanding of gum elements, components, and screens

Gum project needs to be in Content folder
	- Set output of files to "Copy if newer". [DONE]
	- 	<ItemGroup>
		<None Update="Content\GumProject\**\*.*">
			<CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
		</None>
		</ItemGroup>

Gum generates a folder called "Screens" - find out how we will make this interact with our scene implementation - as it is part of the graphics library
