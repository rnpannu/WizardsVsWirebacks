---- GAME SYSTEMS Sprint One Outline ----

The goal of this sprint is to build out and define the core gameplay systemsand utilities defined in the design document.

These should largely be decoupled from any MonoGame Specific Code.

The main items to be built out this sprint are as follows:

1. RunState Class:
    The 'RunState' will contain all core information that defines a run. the class should be serializable, meaning we can write the state to a JSON object, then read the JSON object back into the game preserving the state of the game in its entirety.

2. Wizard Class:
    A simple wizard class which can be built out later. this should be a simple representation of a wizard which can be serialized and stored.

3. Wizard Manager:
    A class which contains a pool of the players wizards, and allows for operations over those wizards. ie add, remove, select, random removal.

4. City Nodes:
    A class which containts information pertaining to out city nodes, to be expanded later.

5. City Graph:
    A serialiable representation of our city graph and nodes.

6. World event interface:
    A world event interface which takes our runstate as an input and modifies its state as needed in events.

7. Random Service:
    A random service which takes a seed from our run state and provides a random generator. this should be the only interface with random in the whole game. seeding will allow for deterministic testing.

8. Serializing and Save/Delete service:
    A service which can serialize runstate into a JSON object, read the JSONobject into the game, and delete said object when needed.
